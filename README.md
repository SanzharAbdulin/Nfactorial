Assesment task

run nameGenerate.py in command line interface by typing 
python nameGenerate.py 

Program asks user to input first letter

"Please provide first letter of name"

After user inputting, program prints a newly generated name 

P.S.
I wasn't able to put into account starter character of each word in counting bigram probabilites
Also I have not generated a appropriate table of bigram probabilities, but you can see generated probability numbers 
if you put print(bigram_probabilities) statement between bigram_probabilities calculation and generateName function
(I did not include it in final task, as it may confuse user, because probability table is not visualling appealing)
